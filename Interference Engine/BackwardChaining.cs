    Notes which helped with the thought process. Will be added to report

    1. if goal is in KB as a fact, return true
    2. Find all rules which have the goal as their conclusion.
    3. Find the premises of those

    Step 1: Define the knowledge base as per the requirements. 
    Step 2: Set the goal or conclusion to begin the backward chaining process. 
    Step 3: Start and iterate the functions. Check the facts to match the goal. Terminate the process if successful; else, iterate over the rules in the knowledge base. Search to match the conclusion with a current goal. Like forward chaining, recursively invoke the backward chaining process for the rule conditions if there is a match. Repeat the previous process until you reach the endpoint. 
    Step 4: Determine the termination condition for the backward chaining process that can be any specific criteria. Output the final result after reaching the endpoint. 

    

    1. Start with initial goal
    2. Finds rule with conclusion is goal
    3. Extract premises of matching rule
    4. Prove premise is true, premise becomes new goal
    5. Repeat until final premise is known to be true, or last premise in chain is false.
