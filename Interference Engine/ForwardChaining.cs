I used this website to help me understand forward chaining. 

psuedocode for FC 

1. Apply value to clauses based on how many are needed to fulfil conditions --> e.g. a=>b, value assigned is 1, since only 1 symbol is required to prove b is true
2. Loop through and find out which clauses are known to be true, put them in a seperate list.
3. Put this list in a Queue, dequeue one, loop through clause dictionary and minus one from dictionary key value whenever one of its conditions are determined to be true from current true proposition symbol
4. If key value of clause becomes 0, if theres a symbol in clause which doesnt currently exist in list of true proposition symbols, add to list and enqueue to end of queue.
5. Check if goal symbol is in true proposition symbol list. If not, dequeue next symbol and repeat process until goal state reached or queue is empty.
